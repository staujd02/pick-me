# React Project

## Overview
The goal of this project is to create a seem-less and fast way to set up a binary choice for a user to pick from.
The first user sets up the option, and then the device is handed off to a second user to make a choice.

The project assumes that the second user may be using the interface without optimal hand-eye coordination, vision, or
complete understanding of the option presented.
